# About me ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my own website.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be a certified professional coach, so I can help individuals and businesses get more of what they want. I am also learning Wordpress, html and css so I can build my own website and also help those that I coach to build theirs. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I can help you get more of what you want out of life.
